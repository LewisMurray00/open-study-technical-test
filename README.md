## Project overview/ Plan

1. Firstly, i read through the briefing and decided to understand what is being asked of me and how i would go about it.

2. After reading through it my next logical step was to install react and create my file, from here i displayed the information that was stored in the API via an async await function.

3. My next step after this, was to create the Navbar that contained a link, which was a mini 'basket'/ shopping cart, this will take you to the customers shopping cart
